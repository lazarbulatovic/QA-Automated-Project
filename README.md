# QA-Automated-Project
This is some project from automated QA
In this project am testing web site funcionality. Site name is Games.rs
Some insight in this project is that I tested many functions, from click simple items, to fill forms for email and register and auto accept cookies button and many more tests.
NOTICE
It is important to note that during testing, errors may occur that are not related to the code or test cases. This happens due to testing on a live website that is not under our control. Additionally, it's possible that some items may not exist, have been modified, or added in the meantime.
